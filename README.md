### Usage 

Morpheus can be used in 2 different ways : 
* to use a Javassist based class(es) transformer(s) via a gradle DSL
* to create a new gradle plugin to apply to an Android project.

### Use a Javassist based class(es) transformer(s)

Add morpheus to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'morpheus'
````

Then configure morpheus to use one or multiple [`ClassTransformer`](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/javassist-build-plugin-api/blob/master/src/main/java/javassist/build/IClassTransformer.java):

```groovy

android {
...
}

import foo.MyTransformer

morpheus {
  transformers = new MyTransformer()
}
```

Morpheus will then add a few tasks to your gradle android app (or lib) automatically :

```bash
gradle tasks --all

transformMyTransformerDebug
copyTransformedMyTransformerDebug
...
```

All variants of the build are enhanced to apply the transformations.

### Example

This repo contains an example to invoke a class transformer to an android projet.

### Create a new gradle plugin to apply to an Android project.

Here are some examples of android gradle plugins based on morpheus : 

* [LogLifeCycle](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/loglifecycle) to log the life cycle of annotated activities, fragments, etc..
* [InjectView](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/injectview) to automatically inject views and fragments into activities, fragments, views, place holder, etc. Works a la [RoboGuice](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/org.roboguice/roboguice).
