Morpheus [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas/morpheus/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas/morpheus)
========

A gradle plugin to transform classes via javassist.

### Usage 

Morpheus can be used in 2 different ways : 
* to use a Javassist based class(es) transformer(s)
* to create a new gradle plugin to trigger it inside an Android project.


### Use a Javassist based class(es) transformer(s)

Add morpheus to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'morpheus'
````

Then configure morpheus to use one or multiple [`ClassTransformer`](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/javassist-build-plugin-api/blob/master/src/main/java/javassist/build/IClassTransformer.java):

```groovy

android {
...
}

import foo.MyTransformer

morpheus {
  transformers = new MyTransformer()
}
```

Morpheus will then add a few tasks to your gradle android app (or lib) automatically :

```bash
gradle tasks --all

transformMyTransformerDebug
copyTransformedMyTransformerDebug
...
```

All variants of the build are enhanced to apply the transformations.

### Example
